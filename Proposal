Team members are:
Yi Zhou. Netid is yiz9. (Captain)
Zhaoyuan Yang. Netid is zy7.
Dongni Yang. Netid is dongniy2.

Our chosen paper is A CrossCollection Mixture Model for Comparative Text Mining.

We are going to use python in this project.

We can't obtain the exact same dataset used in the paper. However, we can use other datasets to achieve similar goals.
