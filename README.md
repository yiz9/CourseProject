# CourseProject

Please fork this repository and paste the github link of your fork on Microsoft CMT. Detailed instructions are on Coursera under Week 1: Course Project Overview/Week 9 Activities.

Progress Report updated. (Used part of our work from MP2. I hope that's ok.)

Project completed. Make sure you check out our Project Report and our Project Presentation, which includes a demo of our source code.
Source code for each part can be found in each folder. We used our own works in MPs and also some online resources. The references can be found in the main branch.
Thank you for grading! If needed, please contact us through the emails provided on the CMT.
