A hairdresser who council officials said repeatedly refused to shut during the Covid-19 lockdown has been forced to shut and is due in court.Sinead Quinn, owner of Quinn Blakey hairdressers in Bradford, "repeatedly" opened several times during lockdown, Kirklees Council said.She is due before magistrates on Monday.The council said Ms Quinn and customers who used the salon had been "illegal, selfish and reckless".More Yorkshire storiesHairdressers were required to close from 5 November under national lockdown restrictions.Ms Quinn, who was issued with fines totalling 17,000 for repeatedly opening, was found to be trading again on Friday.On Saturday the council submitted a closure notice meaning only the owner, occupier, or someone who lives at the premises could enter.It also applied for a court order under the Anti-Social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act 2014 which if broken it meant an even higher fine and/or prison term.Previously Ms Quinn said on Instagram she did not accept the fines issued since 9 November, and posted a notice on the salon door quoting the Magna Carta.Councillor Paul Davies said the council sympathised with businesses suffering under lockdown restrictions but said "public health must come first"."The actions taken by [Ms Quinn] and those who have given her custom during this period have been illegal, selfish and reckless," he said."[She] has wilfully endangered herself, her customers, the wider community and our staff."He said the pandemic had had a "devastating" impact on livelihoods and the council did not want to penalise businesses, but said the lockdown rules were needed to lower infection rates and save lives and Quinn Blakey was given "every opportunity to do the right thing"."Public health must come first. We have been left with no choice," he said.Follow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook , Twitter and Instagram . Send your story ideas to yorkslincs.news@bbc.co.uk .
Food parcels are still being handed out to about 150 people by a charity months after the country's first lockdown. Bedfordshire-based Social Education Voluntary Association (SEVA) Trust UK said it had worked "without a break" since Covid restrictions in March. Jenny Woods, 73, a Bedford widow who has received parcels, said you should never be "too proud or independent" to ask for help.The group is supporting families, rough sleepers and international students. Charan Sekhon, the Sharnbrook-based charity's chairman, said: "We are not an emergency response or food support charity. In light of Covid-19 and serious impacts on our local communities and overseas students, we decided to help our communities. "We are trying our best to operate as per seva , meaning selfless service in Punjabi and Hindi, principles given by the first Sikh guru, Guru Nanak, who started the concept of langer, meaning free food for the needy."He said the charity started in 2016 and is currently helping 50 families or individuals, 45 homeless people, all in Bedford, and international students across the country.It has also helped more than 1,000 people and students in India since the pandemic started.Other Bedfordshire stories you may be interested in:Surge in demand for free lunches for children Demand for free food 'sky-rockets' during lockdown 'Inspiration' who ran London marathon aged 88 diesSusan, from Bedford who only wanted to be known by her first name, is a single mother with children, aged 11 and 13.

England could face a third wave of coronavirus if ministers do not "get the balance right" with restrictions, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab says.He defended the move to a tiered approach when England's lockdown ends on Wednesday, saying the curbs are needed to "bear down" on the pandemic.MPs will vote on the system on Tuesday, with Labour undecided on its stance.The PM has told MPs the restrictions will expire on 3 February in a bid to stop a Commons rebellion.In a letter to all MPs and peers, Boris Johnson said rules could be eased in December, MPs could vote again in January and the tier system could end in February.But Labour's shadow foreign secretary Lisa Nandy said her party's support was "not unconditional" and they were seeking "clarity" about the tier system.It comes as a further 12,155 people have tested positive for coronavirus, bringing the UK total to 1,617,327. There have been another 215 deaths of people who had tested positive for the virus within the previous 28 days, the total under that measure now being 58,245. Has England's lockdown worked? Why is so much of the North and Midlands in the top tier? Don't 'take brakes off' Covid measures - scientistEngland's new system will see regions placed in one of three tiers: medium, high and very high.In total, 99% of England will enter the highest two tiers, with tight restrictions on bars and restaurants and a ban on households mixing indoors. Only Cornwall, the Isle of Wight and Isles of Scilly will be in the lowest tier.Elsewhere in the UK, Northern Ireland has begun a two-week circuit-breaker lockdown , while in Scotland each area has been placed in one of five tiers.In Wales, First Minister Mark Drakeford said pubs, restaurants and bars will be subject to stricter restrictions - which are not yet finalised - in the run-up to Christmas. They will come into force from Friday, 4 December.When asked whether there could be a third national lockdown, Mr Raab told the BBC's Andrew Marr the government was "doing everything we can to avoid that".But he said there was a "risk" of a third wave "if we don't get the balance right". He told Sky's Sophy Ridge on Sunday the tiers would be downgraded in areas where the virus was in retreat, saying: "We are starting with a more restrictive approach than previously with the localised approach."But that allows us to ease up when we are confident the virus is going down and stabilised - there's a review every two weeks."Asked whether the government was looking at breaking counties into smaller areas for the tiers, given differences in rates of the virus within tier areas, Mr Raab said: "The problem is you've got to get the geographic size sufficiently effective that you don't find the smaller enclaves of lower level virus shooting up because they are not subject to the restrictions in the high levels around them."Labour's Ms Nandy told the BBC's Andrew Marr her party "will act in the public interest"."We need to know first of all that these measures are tough enough to get control of the virus, otherwise what we are asking businesses to do is go through significant pain, people laid off, some businesses at risk of collapsing, without being able to show that this is worth it," she said.She added that there also needed to be "proper support" in place.Meanwhile, in a bid to answer MPs' concerns, Mr Johnson wrote to them outlining a timeline of when - and how - the tiered approach will end.In his letter, Mr Johnson said:Regulations have a "sunset" clause - or expiry date - of 3 February Tiers will be reviewed every two weeks, with the first review due on 16 December At the end of January, MPs will have another vote on the tiered approach and decide whether measures stay in place until the end of March The government will publish the circumstances that need to change for an area to move down a tierIn his letter to the public, the prime minister urged people to support the new system and "work together" with tiering, testing and vaccines.He said: "We can't blow it now. We can't just throw it all away - not when freedom is in sight."By Ellie Price, political reporter, BBC News'Tis the season to be jolly careful, said Boris Johnson last week. And he needs to be, with a potential rebellion of his own MPs to worry about. His letter to all MPs is a change of tone from yesterday when Michael Gove warned it wasn't just ministers who had to take difficult decisions, but MPs too. This morning, the foreign secretary went for the more reassuring approach and piled on the domestic diplomacy. "We are listening", he said. One Tory MP told me this morning that the letter was "nice" but he still hadn't decided how to vote. Many Tory MPs are waiting for an impact assessment- looking at the economic, social and health effects of the tier system, due to be published on Monday. So far, Labour haven't said they will support the measures, but they've never voted against Covid health restrictions in the past.Writing in the Sunday Times , Conservative Damian Green, MP for Ashford in Kent - a tier 3 area - said he will vote against the restrictions on Tuesday.He said that in Kent there was "an extraordinary divergence in Covid rates" and there was "no logic" in putting the whole county in the same tier."The new approach punishes rural areas next to large towns or cities and is bound to reduce public acceptance of these restrictions," he said.Tory MP Steve Baker said he wanted to see the data the government was basing its new system on.He tweeted that MPs were "glad to share in the burden of decision", but added: "That's why we need the information necessary to show the government's restrictions will do more good than harm, in full and in time."LOCKDOWN LOOK-UP: The rules in your area SOCIAL DISTANCING: What are the rules now?

When the prime minister addressed the nation on Thursday following the announcement of England's latest tier restrictions, he reserved much praise for one city in particular.Despite recording the third highest coronavirus spike in Europe just six weeks ago, Liverpool's restrictions have been downgraded.Boris Johnson described it as "a success story which we want other parts of the country to replicate", so how exactly did they do it?On a clear night in late July, Liverpool lifted the Premier League trophy, the club's first top flight success in 30 years. The spring wave of Covid-19 cases was largely over and life was beginning to get back on track. But local health experts were concerned."I think it's fair to say that we were always worried in Liverpool," says Louise Kenny, executive pro-vice chancellor at the University of Liverpool's health and life sciences department."I think those of us who were well-sighted on the amount of community transmission were always worried that we would have a bad second wave because we never got down to the exceptionally low levels that were seen elsewhere in the country."As schools reopened, pubs got busier and the prime minister encouraged workers back to the office, cases in Liverpool started to rise once more.Before long, a slow trickle became a rapid spike, with 635 cases per 100,000 recorded in the city region on 12 October. Despite some very public warnings, Joe Anderson says he wasn't able to speak directly to the government until shortly before that peak.Johnson: Covid tiers will bring clarity Move to tier 2 due to 'hard work and sacrifice' 'Remarkable decline' in Covid after mass testingDowning Street had been formulating a three-tier system and he was invited to join a video call with Mr Johnson's senior adviser Lord Lister and Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick.During long, sometimes tense, meetings over three consecutive days, the three men and officials on either side thrashed out the details of a plan. They all agreed that Liverpool should enter the highest tier, but arguments focused on a financial relief package.On the third evening, an agreement had been all but reached. But with the finer points still to be signed off and Liverpool's MPs not yet officially in the loop, details of the negotiations leaked."We found out from the news," says one Liverpool MP. "The government didn't talk to local MPs at all, it was pretty disgraceful."Like most of the UK, Liverpool was still reeling from the financial effects of the spring lockdown and some worried that further restrictions would only make the situation worse.At the Micah Liverpool food bank, executive director Paul O'Brien says he and other volunteers noticed a change."You can see it sort of physically when people walk up to the food bank. I think once you've been doing these things for a couple of years, myself and the volunteers are able to say 'oh, they're coming to the food bank'."Then all of a sudden those people who you think are just walking past are coming in and you think 'oh, they're using the food bank as well'."These are people who've only just come out of work or not long come out of work, have used up all their savings and now they've been forced into a position where they've had to use a food bank."Several business owners phoned Mr Anderson in tears over the measures, but the mayor was determined that lives should come first.That position became all too close to home when on 16 October, just two days after Liverpool officially entered tier three, the mayor's brother, Bill, passed away."Bill was in the intensive care unit in the Royal Liverpool Hospital," says Mr Anderson."He was taken in at 2 o'clock in the afternoon. At quarter to 10 that evening he lost the battle."I'm absolutely clear that if lockdown would have happened in September, then Bill I believe would be alive today, but so would many other thousands of people."For some time, the government had been considering piloting a system of mass testing. During that initial wrangling with Lord Lister, Mr Anderson sniffed an opportunity."I said to Ed Lister, it's not just about money, we need some physical resources, so what about using the armed forces to help us manage and do some of things around testing and his jaw dropped a little bit."Several days later, Health Secretary Matt Hancock, who knew Mr Anderson from his days as Theresa May's culture secretary, called up the mayor of Liverpool to ask if he'd be interested in hosting the pilot.The conversation didn't last long."I grabbed it with both hands," says the mayor, "because I knew it was going to help us."Liverpool has a long history of public health interventions, including a period of mass testing for TB in 1959. That local expertise was soon drawn upon."We were offered the chance to work with the Department of Health and Social Care," says the University of Liverpool's Louise Kenny, "and our military colleagues who very kindly came to the city to provide logistics and support for the rollout.""But we've had a pretty free rein really in the ongoing design of how best to use that capacity for serial testing and what the university brings is the ability to analyse this pilot and provide that data to inform next steps, both locally and hopefully nationally," she adds.Since mass testing began in early November, research has shown that take-up in the city's most deprived areas has been low and Paul O'Brien says many of the people he meets at the food bank have concerns about both testing and vaccines."Exactly what's happened with the testing seems to have happened with the vaccine and I do think it will be something that people get behind eventually, but we just need more information."There's so much, sort of, ambiguity about where it's going to be rolled out, when it's going to be rolled out, who are the target groups it's going to be rolled out to. "There's just so many unanswered questions aren't there?"Since mass testing began in Liverpool, the number of cases there has fallen rapidly.After Thursday's announcement that Liverpool will be downgraded to tier two, Joe Anderson has pointed to the wider city's efforts. Some in government have heaped praise on Liverpool's leaders, suggesting that the key factor was the speed with which they agreed to the original tier three restrictions in October, in contrast they say with areas like Greater Manchester. But that's not a comparison that sits favourably with the mayor."I think it's outrageous to be frank. We're not a poodle, we're not a lapdog. I resent and reject any claims of compliance."I wish they would say it to my face, because I've got a pair of boxing gloves downstairs, I'd smack them right in the gob."Listen to Jack's report from Liverpool on BBC Radio 4's Westminster Hour at 22:00 GMT on Sunday
When Paula-Jayne Tate won a competition for her family to visit Santa Claus in a County Donegal village, she screamed with joy. The mother-of-four was particularly delighted for her five-year-old daughter, Kaidence, who was born with spina bifida and hydrocephalus, a condition that causes a build-up of fluid in the brain. She said meeting Father Christmas would have been a "magical" end to a terrible year for Kaidence, who is recovering from multiple brain surgeries.But their visit has been cancelled due to the two-week period of tougher Covid-19 lockdown measures introduced on Friday.The Tates, from Newtownabbey, County Antrim, are among many families across Northern Ireland who have had to rethink their annual visits to visit Santa this Christmas due to the pandemic.Kaidence, who has been shielding with her family since March, also missed last year's festivities due to illness, her mother said."It has been a very difficult year and planning to see Santa meant the world to us," said Paula-Jayne."We have not had any celebrations at all this year - no birthday, Easter or Halloween parties - so seeing Santa would have been magical."The timing was also good because Kaidence is doing so well at the moment."It would have been the perfect end to a terrible year with the hope that 2021 will bring more positivity."Paula-Jayne said the family hoped to organise a telephone call from Santa in place of their usual visit to the grotto.Pat Doherty, from Donegal's Lapland in Ballyliffin, said it was difficult to let families like the Tates down.In the past, he said they had catered for up to 17,000 visitors, but had only accepted 3,000 bookings this year due to Covid-19."Our bookings start to come in in August and by September this year we stopped taking new bookings because of the way things were going [with the virus] in Donegal," he said.November bookings had been cancelled due to restrictions in the Republic of Ireland, while Stormont's restrictions have hit December bookings as most visitors to Ballyliffin Lapland travel from Northern Ireland, said Mr Doherty."We spent a month building and planning the village, and we were ready to go."We are waiting to see what happens next. There is nothing else we can do."Claudine Owens, who has five children, had been looking forward to meeting Santa in a rural cottage which has also been shut down.Mrs Owens, from Seaforde, County Down, is disappointed they will have to forego many of their family traditions this year.Silver Santa to bring Christmas to lonely elderly Three NI households allowed to meet over Christmas"I felt like it would be something normal and exciting after a hard year," she said."Visits to Santa are special. I keep all the photographs of our visits every year in a box, so it is sad."But it has also made me realise how fortunate we have been in other years to do all the lovely things we do before Christmas."Hugh Black, manager of the Tower Centre, Ballymena, said the shopping centre's Santa grotto had not been able to open yet due to restrictions on indoor visitor attractions."We had 5,500 children through the grotto last year," he said. "That is how many disappointed families we will have if it can't go ahead at all. "It is a huge deal."Mr Black remained optimistic the centre would be able to open the grotto if restrictions on non-essential services are lifted as planned on 11 December.In the meantime, Father Christmas is reading children's stories in weekly videos posted on the centre's social media platforms, which Mr Black said gave children "a chance to see Santa in their homes".Garden centre owner Robin Mercer said he was disappointed to cancel the visits of hundreds of families who had booked appointments with Santa during this two-week circuit breaker.Hillmount Garden Centre's grotto had been adapted to enable social distancing, including larger rooms, a booking system and temperature testing, said Mr Mercer."It is a big responsibility to host Santa, we feel like we are letting families down, even if it is out of our control," he said."It's not just for ourselves, it's for all the other places that do Santa's grottos."Mr Mercer said he remained hopeful there would be some easing of restrictions after the circuit-breaker, allowing at least some hopeful children to get their wish of seeing Santa this year.However, one thing is for certain, some children may not be able to visit Santa this year, but he will still be leaving presents under the tree on 25 December.
There have been more than 1.6 million confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK and nearly 60,000 people have died, government figures show. However, these figures include only people who have died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus and other measures suggest the number of deaths is higher.Find out how the pandemic has affected your area and how it compares with the national average: If you can't see the look-up click here.After the first peak in April, cases started rising again in July, with the rate of growth increasing sharply in September and October, before falling again in the past two weeks.On Sunday, the government announced a further 12,155 confirmed cases. It is thought the infection rate was much higher during the first peak in spring, but testing capacity at the time was too limited to detect the true number of daily cases.The data for cases can also be broken down by region and comparing the change in those figures by week gives a sense of where there has been a recent increase in newly-reported infections.The latest figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), which is tracking Covid-19 in the community by testing a group of people across the country on a regular basis, also suggest that infections have levelled off in recent weeks.Approximately one in 85 people in homes in England had coronavirus in the week ending 21 November, according to the ONS. That's about 633,000 people, slightly up on the previous week, with the rate of new infections increasing in the East Midlands and North East while levelling off or declining in the rest of the country.In Wales, about one in 185 (16,400 people) had the virus during the same time period, while in Northern Ireland rates are thought to be decreasing at around one in 145 people (about 12,700 people). In Scotland, the figure was one in 115 (about 45,700 people).Coronavirus in Scotland: Key figures and trends What do the stats tell us in Wales?The average number of daily deaths has been rising since September, following the first peak in April.On Sunday, the government announced a further 215 deaths. Of these, 194 deaths were in England, 16 in Wales, three in Northern Ireland and two in Scotland.Rules were amended over the summer to include deaths in the coronavirus total only if they occurred within 28 days of a positive test. Previously in England, all deaths after a positive test were included.England has seen the majority of UK deaths from Covid-19. Using the 28-day cut-off, there have been more than 50,000. Although hospital admissions for Covid-19 remain below the levels seen in the spring, there are big regional disparities. The North West, North East and Yorkshire, and Midlands have seen the highest number of admissions but the situation in all three now appears to be improving. Cases have risen across large parts of England, with other spikes in areas of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.The red areas on the map below are those currently seeing the highest number of cases per 100,000 people.Restrictions have been tightened across the UK in an effort to tackle the number of rising cases. In England, each local authority will be placed in one of the new three tiers when the national lockdown ends on 2 December. In Northern Ireland, a new two-week " circuit-break " lockdown began on 27 November. In Wales, a two-week "firebreak" lockdown, which began in the last week of October, has now ended but some restrictions are still in place. Scotland has a five-tier system of alert levels with different measures in place in different parts of the country.UK leaders have agreed to allow up to three households to meet indoors during a five-day Christmas period of 23-27 December.

GLOBAL TRACKER: Where are the virus hotspots? YOUR QUESTIONS: We answer your queriesWhen looking at the overall death toll from coronavirus, official figures count deaths in three different ways.Government figures count people who tested positive for coronavirus and died within 28 days.But there are two other measures. The first includes all deaths where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certificate, even if the person had not been tested for the virus. The most recent figures suggest there had been more than 66,000 deaths by 13 November.The second measure counts all deaths over and above the usual number at the time of year - that figure was more than 73,000 by 13 November.The most recent figures available from the ONS are for the second week of November, which show there were 13,972 deaths registered in the UK.Some 2,838 of these deaths involved Covid-19 - up from 2,225 the week before. Deaths normally do rise at this time of the year, but the data from the ONS and its counterparts in Scotland and Northern Ireland show the second wave of the virus has pushed the death rate above the average seen over the past five years.Overall, the figures are still well below the peak of 9,495 deaths recorded in a week, reached on 17 April. The "R number" is the average number of people an infected person will pass the disease on to. If R is below one, then the number of people contracting the disease will fall; if it is above one, the number will grow. The government's current estimate for the R number across the whole of the UK is 0.9 to 1.The estimate for England is 0.9 to 1, while for Scotland it is 0.8 to 1. The estimate for Wales is 0.8 to 1 and in Northern Ireland it is 0.9 to 1.1.The government has said in the past that the R number is one of the most important factors in making policy decisions.
England's new Covid tier system has a "sunset" expiry date of 3 February, Boris Johnson has told MPs in a bid to prevent a Commons rebellion.The current lockdown ends on Wednesday, and many Tory MPs are unhappy with the toughened tiers that will replace it. MPs will vote on the system on Tuesday, with Labour undecided on its stance.In a letter to MPs, the PM said rules could be eased in December, MPs could vote again in January, and the tier system could end in February.And writing separately in the Mail on Sunday , Mr Johnson said he believed Easter would mark a "real chance to return to something like life as normal".He warned, however, there would be "disastrous consequences" for the NHS if the government did not introduce the new tiered system when lockdown ends.Has England's lockdown worked? Why is so much of the North and Midlands in the top tier? England's new system will see regions placed in one of three tiers: medium, high and very high.In total, 99% of England will enter the highest two tiers, with tight restrictions on bars and restaurants and a ban on households mixing indoors. Only Cornwall, the Isle of Wight and Isles of Scilly will be in the lowest tier.In a bid to quell MPs' concerns, Mr Johnson wrote to them outlining a timeline of when - and how - the tiered approach will end.In his letter, Mr Johnson said:Regulations have a "sunset" clause - or expiry date - of 3 February Tiers will be reviewed every two weeks, and areas can move down the tiers from 16 December At the end of January, MPs will have another vote on the tiered approach and decide whether measures stay in place until the end of March The government will publish the circumstances that need to change for an area to move down a tierIn his letter to the public, the prime minister urged people to support the new system and "work together" with tiering, testing and vaccines.He said: "We can't blow it now. We can't just throw it all away - not when freedom is in sight. "We have worked too hard, lost too many, sacrificed too much, just to see our efforts incinerated in another volcanic eruption of the virus."Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab told the BBC's Andrew Marr that having a tiered approach "allows us to have these localised restrictions".He said there was a "risk" of a third wave "if we don't get the balance right."Asked by Sophy Ridge on Sky News whether the government was looking at breaking counties into smaller areas for the tiers, given differences in rates of the virus within tier areas, Mr Raab said the measures would be reviewed every two weeks."But the problem is you've got to get the geographic size sufficiently effective that you don't find the smaller enclaves of lower level virus shooting up because they are not subject to the restrictions in the high levels around them," he said.Labour's shadow foreign secretary Lisa Nandy told the BBC's Andrew Marr that her party's support of the government's coronavirus restrictions was "not unconditional" and they "will act in the public interest"."We need to know first of all that these measures are tough enough to get control of the virus, otherwise what we are asking businesses to do is go through significant pain, people laid off, some businesses at risk of collapsing, without being able to show that this is worth it."She added that there also needed to be "proper support" in place.Elsewhere in the UK, Northern Ireland has begun a two-week circuit-breaker lockdown , while in Scotland each area has been placed in one of five tiers.In Wales, First Minister Mark Drakeford said pubs, restaurants and bars will be subject to stricter restrictions - which are not yet finalised - in the run-up to Christmas. They will come into force from Friday, 4 December.Conservative rebels were increasingly confident that they could demolish Boris Johnson's majority of 80 on Tuesday when the Commons votes on the proposed three tiers of restrictions in England. That would make the PM reliant on Labour votes to get his measures through - and the opposition hasn't yet committed to backing him.So, on Saturday night, there was a dramatic intervention to try to defuse the revolt.In the letter to his MPs, Mr Johnson - in effect - pleads with them to give him the benefit of the doubt this week, in return for a new vote on the restrictions at the end of January.If the government were to lose that vote, restrictions would end on 3 February.He also seeks to reassure them that the review of restrictions on 16 December will be genuine, so it's possible some areas could move down a tier before ChristmasBut one potential rebel, the former minister Tim Loughton told the BBC that the PM would have to do more to win him over.He said: "We asked for a lot of information and that letter doesn't contain it. So unless we get it by Tuesday... then it doesn't change anything I'm afraid." It's still possible Mr Johnson's new promises will sway some waverers, though a major rebellion may simply be postponed rather than avoided entirely.Writing in the Sunday Times , Conservative Damian Green, MP for Ashford in Kent - a tier 3 area - said he would vote against the restrictions on Tuesday.He said that in Kent there was "an extraordinary divergence in Covid rates" and there was "no logic" in putting the whole county in the same tier."The new approach punishes rural areas next to large towns or cities and is bound to reduce public acceptance of these restrictions," he said.Tory MP Steve Baker said he wanted to see the data the government was basing its new system on.He tweeted that MPs were "glad to share in the burden of decision", but added: "That's why we need the information necessary to show the government's restrictions will do more good than harm, in full and in time."But writing in the Sunday Times , England's deputy chief medical officer Jenny Harries warned: "If we relax our guard and the virus spreads too quickly then all the hard-won progress will be undone."She said that once the lockdown ends in England "there is no other way to keep the virus under control", urging people to "hold on a little longer".On Saturday, a further 479 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were reported in the UK, bringing the total to 58,030.

The NHS's former cancer director is concerned England could see the first decrease in survival rates for decades because of the Covid pandemic.In England, 60% fewer patients with suspected cancer were seen in April compared with the same month in 2019.Prof Sir Mike Richards told BBC Politics East the drop "will have an impact on cancer survival rates".NHS England said while some people were put off coming forward for checks, the NHS message was "do not delay".Sir Mike, who was national cancer director in the Department of Health between 1999 and 2013, said it was too early to put a figure on what the overall effect on cancer survival would be but he said "what we do know is that over the last 20, 30, 40 years, cancer survival rates in this country have been going up year on year". "There is obviously a concern that may actually go down again in the year 2020. But we won't know that for some time," he said."We know cancer has been hard hit during the pandemic. As soon as the first wave hit, patients weren't coming forward to their GPs so they weren't getting referred to hospitals. "Diagnostic services were also hit. Surgery was much more difficult."Things have picked up since then, he said, and added: "Instead of the steady rise that we have seen it is possible we could see some decline."Colin Allison, 64, from Swardeston in Norfolk, has a brain tumour touching his upper spine. In February, he went to his GP with symptoms but because of Covid he could not get a scan until July."They phoned me a few days beforehand and said 'we're cancelling all routine MRIs'," he said. "But I said 'it's not routine - I've got symptoms coming back of a brain tumour'."As Mr Allison waited for a scan, symptoms such as double vision worsened. He said he was now waiting for an operation."Yes, Covid-19 can be life threatening," he said. "But how many people are dying from cancer this year?"The Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust said it had increased its MRI capacity after some diagnostic services were hit by the first wave of the pandemic. It said it was investing 8m to replace its CT and MRI scanners with newer imaging equipment and added: "We would welcome Mr Allison contacting us so we can look into his concerns."Fear of catching Covid-19 made the over-65s in particular reluctant to see their GPs during the initial stages of the outbreak, and cancer was most common in older age groups, Sir Mike said.But he praised the way the NHS had "done a great job" to recover from that first wave, with latest data indicating cancer services were getting back to normal."In this country in any case we are behind other countries in our cancer survival rates, so there is a major catching up job to do on that anyway," he said."A lot of that is about making sure patients can get diagnosed earlier."He highlighted the shortage of scanning equipment in a recent report for NHS England. "The figures are very stark," he said.It showed that in 2017 England was at the bottom of a table of 23 developed countries for CT (Computerized Tomography) scanners per 100,000 population. Chancellor Rishi Sunak's Spending Review on Wednesday announced extra investment in diagnostic equipment as part of a 6.3bn increase in NHS spending for 2021-22.An NHS England spokeswoman said: "Cancer survival rates are at a record high in England and the number of people being treated for cancer is now back to usual levels of activity. "The NHS message to the public has always been clear - do not delay, help us to help you by coming forward for care."
